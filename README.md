## The Problem

Traditional loyalty programs pose significant challenges for both businesses and customers:

### For SMEs:
- High implementation and maintenance costs

- Lack of advanced analytics and customer insights
- Low customer retention rates
- Limited marketing reach

### For Customers:
- Program fragmentation leading to multiple cards/apps
- Usage restrictions limiting reward redemption options
- Point expiration causing loss of accumulated benefits
- Devaluation of points due to inflation
- Irrelevant or generic rewards
